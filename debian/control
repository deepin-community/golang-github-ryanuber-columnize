Description: Easy column formatted output for golang
 Columnize is a really small Go package that makes building CLI's a little bit
 easier. In some CLI designs, you want to output a number similar items in a
 human-readable way with nicely aligned columns. However, figuring out how wide
 to make each column is a boring problem to solve and eats your valuable time.
 .
 This package contains the source.
